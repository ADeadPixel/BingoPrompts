These JSON templates are meant to be copy and pasted into https://www.bingosync.com/ in their Custom game board.

### Walkthrough
- Copy your desired JSON collection that will drive your bingo game
- Head over to https://www.bingosync.com/
- In their "New Room" module fill out the appropriate information
- Set the "Game" to "Custom (Advanced)"
- _I recommend setting the game to the "Randomized" variant_
- Paste in copied JSON into the "Board" section
- Set your game mode
- Leave the seed blank (unless you found a variant you like)
